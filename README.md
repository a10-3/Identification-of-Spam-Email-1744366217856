# Spam Detection Email Classifier

## Project Overview
This project is a simple spam detection application developed using Python and Flask. It utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained on a small dataset of example emails and is capable of making predictions based on user input through a web interface.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd spam-detection-email-classifier
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`. Once your virtual environment is active, install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file (manually if no file is present):
   ```bash
   pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas joblib
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Enter the email text you want to classify in the input box.
3. Click on the submit button to get the prediction of whether the email is spam or ham.
4. The result will be displayed on a new page.

## Features

- Simple user interface to input email text.
- Predicts whether the input email is 'spam' or 'ham'.
- Uses a trained Naive Bayes model for email classification.
- Displays error messages for empty input or model prediction failures.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- Flask: web framework
- scikit-learn: machine learning library for model handling
- pandas: used for handling data
- joblib: for saving and loading the trained model

You can install all dependencies using the command mentioned in the Installation section.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
spam-detection-email-classifier/
│
├── app.py                # Main Flask application file.
├── spam_model.py         # Contains the spam detection model training and prediction logic.
├── templates/            # Directory containing HTML templates.
│   ├── index.html        # Input page for email text.
│   └── result.html       # Page displaying the prediction result.
└── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies (if applicable).
```

### Note
- Make sure to replace `[REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of the repository when cloning it.
- The application is currently set to run in debug mode for development purposes. Ensure to switch to production settings when deploying.
